This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Spoilralert

This is a movie db site with user added spoilers. Users can search for a specific title and choose from a dropdown of suggested titles. If title doesn't exist in spoilralert db, they can search from full movie db and add request or spoilr (if logged in). Spoilers are by default hidden so the site can also be used just as a regular movie db.
I built this as my project exam for my studies in front-end development.
